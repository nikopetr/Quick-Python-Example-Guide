# Quick-Python-Example-Guide
Guide which focuses on the fundamental syntax of the language without the classic "this is variable, and here's what you can do with variables".

This guide-examples demonstrate some operations that can be easily implemented in Python compared to other programming languages. Also the guide will really speed things up if you are going from another language you already know (e.x. Java) to Python.

The examples might NOT be helpful for someone who does not already have a basic background programming experience.

##  What the examples cover
- Getting input from user, Print Statements
- Variables and Casting
- Mathematical-Logical Operators
- Operations with Strings
- Lists and list operations
- Tuples
- Logical Operators, Comparing for Equality
- If/else/elif-Statements
- Functions/Helper Methods (Optional Parameters)
- Classes and Objects

The code examples are well commented and explain every step in detail
